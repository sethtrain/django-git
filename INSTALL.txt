Thanks for downloading django-git.

To install it, run the following command inside this directory:

    python setup.py install

Or if you'd prefer you can simply place the included ``django_git``
directory somewhere on your Python path, or symlink to it from
somewhere on your Python path; this is useful if you're working from a
Subversion checkout.
